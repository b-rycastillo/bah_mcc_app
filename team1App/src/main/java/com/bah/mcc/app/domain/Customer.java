	//  Workshop:
	//
	//  Make a concrete implementation of a customer domain.  What attributes do you need for
	//  Customer?  At the least, you need to be able to uniquely identify instances of Customer.
	//  Customers have user names, passwords, and email addresses - how would you implement that? 
	//
	//  You may find your implementation changes over time; a simple in-memory implementation 
	//  may be replaced by a robust implementation that makes use of a relational database
	//  as its persistent store, or you may choose some other mechanism.  In thinking about 
	//  how you implement the custome domain, what do you think about to make it easier and 
	//  safer to move from one represenstation to another.
